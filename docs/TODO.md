# Exhale To-Do List

Last updated: May 18, 2026

## Completed Rhythm Changes

- Settle In now lasts 8 seconds before the first guided inhale.
- The core rhythm is now 4-4-6-8, with an 8-second Rest phase.
- Session breath counts were recalibrated so the 3, 5, 7, and 10 minute labels stay accurate.

## Completed UI Polish

- Sound preview has visible state plus screen-reader status.
- Off is separated from sound textures and uses a mute icon.
- Time, Circle Size, and Sound selected states share one quieter visual language.
- View Sequence and Settings were merged into one Session Setup drawer.
- Begin remains the only solid green primary action.
- Still is now audibly present.
- Circle Size and Sound live inside Session Setup from the start; the 3-session hiding rule was removed.
- When available, Resume now appears directly below Begin and before Session Setup.

## Completed From Sync And Measurement Follow-Up

- Supabase sync copy now indicates that timer setting, Circle Size, audio choice, and Practice History sync.
- App events are logged for email-synced users when they select a timer, start a session, exit early through the app, or complete a session.
- Practice completion is still recorded in `breathing_sessions`; behavioral counts now have a lightweight path through `app_events`.

## Completed From Full UI Audit

- Full UI audit was run against the current local UI, with browser checks for Home, Stats, Settle In, and the running breathing page.
- Settle In now has an immediate quiet Exit path, and Escape opens the exit guard during the 8-second buffer.
- Opening the exit guard during Settle In pauses the settle timer; Resume returns to Settle In instead of starting the session behind the dialog.
- The mute control now meets the 44x44 touch target floor.
- The Begin button has more space above it so it no longer feels cramped against the timer buttons.
- Home orb size changes and the session progress bar now animate with transforms instead of layout-width/height transitions.

## Completed Preview Prep

- The current beta-ready work was committed and pushed to the `preview` branch for Vercel preview deployment.
- A dedicated `docs/USER_FEEDBACK.md` file now exists for anonymized tester notes, critique synthesis, and product decisions.

## Completed Production Deploy

- The latest work was pushed to both `preview` and `master`.
- Vercel reported the production deployment complete for commit `c6ca1b6`.
- Commit `fbaf95b` was pushed to both `master` and `preview` with Session Setup, beta feedback capture, default-setting, and Hold-copy polish.

## Completed Local Smoke Test

- Local Home, Begin, Session Setup, running breathing session, exit guard, audio choice selection, Practice History, and sync copy were smoke tested with no browser console errors.
- The latest Vercel preview URL was found, but it currently redirects to Vercel login before the app loads.

## Completed Documentation Polish

- Markdown docs were aligned with the current Next.js version, Resume placement, Session Setup, Supabase tables, Vercel preview access note, and beta handoff flow.
- `docs/USER_FEEDBACK.md` now includes a current test surface and a short beta test prompt.

## Completed Beta Surface Decision

- For the current beta round, testers will use the live production site at `https://exhale.guide`.
- Vercel preview access can wait until a future test needs non-production changes.

## Completed iPhone Beta Feedback Follow-Up

- Production iPhone tester notes were captured in `docs/USER_FEEDBACK.md`.
- Hold copy was softened to avoid mentioning strain.
- One low-light iPhone readability pass reported that the color changes were clear and usable.
- Settle In, pause length, phase-marker sounds, the main menu structure, and the Circle label were validated as working well.

## Completed Auth Sign-In Sync

- Practice History now has an optional email sign-in flow instead of an OTP-only sync branch.
- New email sign-ins convert the current anonymous Supabase user where possible, preserving existing `breathing_sessions`, `user_settings`, and `app_events` rows under the same user id.
- Existing email sign-ins merge local practice history into the signed-in `breathing_sessions` records and restore synced timer length, Circle Size, and sound choice through `user_settings`.

## Completed Mobile Sound Control

- The in-session sound control now sits bottom-center between Pause and Exit, away from the top-right fullscreen toggle.
- The sound control has a 44px mobile tap target, a clearer on/off icon state, and safe-area-aware bottom placement for iPhone.
- After sound is turned on during a session, a short hint appears: "still quiet? check silent mode".

## Remaining To-Do

1. Test cross-device sync on Device B and verify Practice History, timer length, Circle Size, and sound choice sync correctly through Supabase.

2. Run one more first-use clarity and rhythm comfort check: "Can you start breathing without thinking?", "Did matching the prompts feel pressuring?", "Did Exhale feel too long?", "Did any sound behavior surprise you?", and "Did Settle In feel optional enough?"

3. After a few synced sessions, review Supabase event counts for timer selections, session starts, Settle In exits, early exits, and completions. Use that to check whether the default timer, sound choice, or first-use flow needs adjustment.

4. Design and build selectable app skins. The current visual direction reads sci-fi and cool; explore a warmer set of user-selectable themes so people can choose the environment that feels safest and most inviting to them.

5. If more testers report breath-timing pressure or a too-long Exhale, test a softer rhythm option such as 4-4-5-8 or a relaxed mode before changing the default 4-4-6-8 pattern.

## Recommended Next Move

Test the new email sign-in on Device B, then run a focused iPhone follow-up on sound clarity and rhythm comfort.
